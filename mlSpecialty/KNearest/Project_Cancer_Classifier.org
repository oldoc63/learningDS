* Cancer Classifier
In this project, we will be using several Python libraries to make a K-Nearest Neighbor classifier that is trained to predict whether a patient has breast cancer.

** Explore the data
*** Task 1
Let's begin by importing the breast cancer data form sklearn. We want to import the function ~load_breast_cancer~ from sklearn.datasets.

Once we've imported the dataset, let's load the data into a variable called ~breast_cancer_data~. Do this by setting ~breast_cancer_data~ equal to the function ~load_breast_cancer()~.

* Script.Py
#+begin_src python :results output
  from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer

  breast_cancer_data = load_breast_cancer()
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
