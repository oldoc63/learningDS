* K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier
*K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)* is a classification algorithm. The central idea is that data points with similar attributes tend to fall into similar categories.

Consider de image to the right. This image is complicated, but for now, let's just focus on where the data points are being placed. Every data point -whether its color is red, green, or white- has an ~x~ value an a ~y~ value. As a result, it can be plotted on this two-dimensional graph.

Next, let's consider the color tof the data. The color represents the class that the K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm is trying to classify. In this image, data points can either have the class green or the class red. If a data point is white, this means that it doesn't have a class yet. The purpose of the algorithm is to classify these unknown points.

Finally, consider the expanding circle around the white point. This circle is finding the k nearest neighbors to the white point. When k = 3, the circle is fairly small. Two of the three nearest neighbors are green, and one is red. So in this case, the algorithm would classify the white point as green. However, when we increase k to 5, the circle expands, and the classification changes. Three of the nearest neighbors are red and two are green, so now the white point will be classified as red.

This is the central idea behind the K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm. If you have a dataset of points where the class of each point is known, you can take a new point with an unknown class, find it's nearest neighbors, and classify it.

Consider the image below:

[[./k_nearest.png]]

    - If k = 1, what would the class of the question mark be?

* Introduction
Before diving into the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm, let's first take a minute to think about an example.

Consider a dataset of movies. Let's brainstorm some features of a movie data point. A feature is a piece of information associated with a data point. Here are some potential features of movie data points:

    - the /lenght/ of the movie in minutes

    - the /budget/ of the movie in dollars

If you think back to the previous exercise, you could imagine movies being places in that two-dimentional space based on those numeric features. There could also be some boolean features: features that are either true or false. For example, here are some potential boolean features:

    - /Black and white./ This feature would be ~True~ for black and white movies and ~False~ otherwise.

    - /Directed by Stanley Kubrick./ This feature would be False for almost every movie, but for the few movies that were directed by Kubrick, it would be True.

Finally, let's think about how we might want to classify a movie. For the rest of this lesson, we're going to be classifying movies as either good or bad. In our dataset, we've classified a movie as good if it had an IMDb rating of 7.0 or greater. Every "good" movie will have a class of 1, while every bad movie will have a class of 0.

We've created some movie data points where the first item in the list is the length, the second is the budget, and the third is whether the movie was directed by Stanley Kubrick.

** Task 1
Add another movie to the code. Add the variable ~gone_with_the_wind~. This movie is 238 minutes long, had a budget of $3,977,000, and was not directed by Stanley Kubrick.

*Hint* ~gone_with_the_wind~ should be a list of three values. The last one should be False.

** Script.py
#+begin_src python
mean_girls = [97, 17000000, False]
the_shining = [146, 19000000, True]
gone_with_the_wind = [238, 3977000, False]
#+end_src

* Distance Between Points - 2D
In the first exercise, we were able to visualize the dataset and estimate the k nearest neighbors of an unknown point. But a computer isn't going to be able to do that!

We need to define what it means for two points to be close together or far apart. To do this, we're going to use the [[https://www.codecademy.com/content-items/8a61a8bd456c17af1e3a6922694c811f/exercises/points][Distance Formula]].

For this example, the data has two dimensions:

    - The length of the movie

    - The movie's release date

Consider /Star Wars/ and /Raiders of the Lost Ark./ Star Wars is 125 minutes long and was released in 1977. Raiders of the Lost Ark is 115 minutes long and was released in 1981.

The distance between the movies is computed below:

$$
\sqrt{(125 - 115)^2 + (1977 - 1981)^2}
$$

** Task 1
Write a function named distance that takes two lists named movie1 and movie2 as parameters.

You can assume that each of these lists contains two numbers -the first number being the movie's runtime and the second number being the year the movie was released. The function should return the distance between the two lists.

Remember, in python, x ** 0.5 will give you the square root of x.

Similarly, x ** 2 will give you the square of x.

*Hint*
Break it into steps:

First, find the distance between the firts dimension of each list:

#+begin_src python
  length_difference = (movie1[0] - movie2[0]) ** 2
#+end_src

Next, find the difference in the years.

#+begin_src python
  year_difference = (movie1[1] - movie2[1]) ** 2
#+end_src

Finally, add those two values together and take the square root:

#+begin_src python
  distance = (length_difference + year_difference) ** 0.5
#+end_src

Return this final distance.

** Task 2
Call the function on some of the movies we've given you.

Print the distance between Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark.

Print the distance between Star Wars and Mean Girls.

Which movie is Star Wars more similar to?

*Hint*
You can find the distance between Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark by doing this:

#+begin_src python
print(distance(star_wars, raiders))
#+end_src


** Script.py

#+begin_src python :results output
  star_wars = [125, 1977]
  raiders = [115, 1981]
  mean_girls = [97, 2004]

  def distance(movie1, movie2):
      length_difference = (movie1[0] - movie2[0]) ** 2
      year_difference = (movie1[1] - movie2[1]) ** 2
      distance = (length_difference + year_difference) ** 0.5
      return distance

  print(distance(star_wars, raiders))
  print(distance(star_wars, mean_girls))
 #+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 10.770329614269007
: 38.897300677553446

* Distance Between Points - 3D
Making a movie rating predictor based on just the length and release date of movies is pretty limited. There are so many more interesting pieces of data about movies that we could use! So let's add another dimension.

Let's say this third dimension is the movie's budget. We now have to find the distance between these two points in three dimensions.

[[./3D.png]]

What if we're not happy with just three dimensions? Unfortunately, it becomes pretty difficult to visualize points in dimensions higher than 3. But that doesn't mean we can't find the distance between them.

The generalized distance formula between points A and B is as follows:

$$
\sqrt{(A_1 - B_1)^2 + (A_2 - B_2)^2 + \cdots + (A_n - B_n)^2}
$$

Here, A_1 - B_1 is the difference between the first feature of each point. A_n - B_n is the difference between the last feature of each point.

Using this formula, we can find the K-Nearest Neighbors of a point in N-dimensional space! We now can use as much information about our movies as we want.

We will eventually use these distances to find the nearest neighbors to an unlabeled point.

** Task 1
Modify your distance function to work with any number of dimensions. Use a for loop to iterate through the dimensions of each movie.

Return the total distance between the two movies.

*Hint*
Create a variable to sum the squared differences of each dimension and start it at 0.

Then loop through each dimension and add the squared difference of each dimension to your new variable:

#+begin_src python
  for i in range(len(movie1)):
      squared_difference += (movie1[i] - movie2[i]) ** 2 
#+end_src

After looping through all of the dimensions of your movies, take the square root of squared_difference and return that new value.

** Task 2
We’ve added a third dimension to each of our movies.

Print the new distance between Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark.

Print the new distance between Star Wars and Mean Girls.

Which movie is Star Wars closer to now?

** Script.py

#+begin_src python :results output
  star_wars = [125, 1977, 11000000]
  raiders = [115, 1981, 18000000]
  mean_girls = [97, 2004, 17000000]

  def distance(movie1, movie2):
    squared_difference = 0
    for i in range(len(movie1)):
      squared_difference += (movie1[i] - movie2[i]) ** 2
      total_distance = squared_difference ** 0.5
    return total_distance

  print(distance(star_wars, raiders))
  print(distance(star_wars, mean_girls))

#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 7000000.000008286
: 6000000.000126083

* Data with different scales: Normalization
In the next three lessons, we'll implement the three steps of the K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm:

    1. Normalize the data

    2. Find the k nearest neighbors

    3. Classify the new point based on those neighbors

When we added the dimension of budget, you might have realized there are some problems with the way our data currently looks.

Consider the two dimensions of release date and budget. The maximum difference between two movies’ release dates is about 125 years (The Lumière Brothers were making movies in the 1890s). However, the difference between two movies’ budget can be millions of dollars.

*/The problem is that the distance formula treats all dimensions equally, regardless of their scale./*

If two movies came out 70 years apart, that should be a pretty big deal. However, right now, that’s exactly equivalent to two movies that have a difference in budget of 70 dollars. The difference in one year is exactly equal to the difference in one dollar of budget. That’s absurd!

Another way of thinking about this is that the budget completely outweighs the importance of all other dimensions because it is on such a huge scale. The fact that two movies were 70 years apart is essentially meaningless compared to the difference in millions in the other dimension.

The solution to this problem is to normalize the data so every value is between 0 and 1. In this lesson, we're going to be using min-max normalization.

** Task 1
Write a function named ~min_max_normalize~ that takes a list of numbers named lst as a parameter (lst short for list).

Begin by storing the minimum and maximum values of the list in variables named minimum and maximum.

*Hint* You can use Python's built in min() and max() functions. ~min(lst)~ will return the minimum value of the lst.

** Task 2
Create an empty list named normalized. Loop through each value in the original list.

Using min-max normalization, normalize the value and add the normalized value to the new list.

After adding every normalized value to normalized, return normalized.

*Hint*
Each normalized value will be (value-minimum)/(maximum-minimum).

** Task 3
Call ~min_max_normalize~ using the given list ~release_dates~. Print the resulting list.

What does the date 1897 get normalized to? Why is it closer to 0 than 1?

** Script.py

#+begin_src python :results output
  release_dates = [1897, 1998, 2000, 1948, 1962, 1950, 1975, 1960, 2017, 1937, 1968, 1996, 1944, 1891, 1995, 1948, 2011, 1965, 1891, 1978]

  def min_max_normalize(lst):
      minimum = min(lst)
      maximum = max(lst)
      normalized = []
      for value in lst:
          norm = (value - minimum) / (maximum - minimum)
          normalized.append(norm)
      return normalized

  print(min_max_normalize(release_dates))  
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: [0.047619047619047616, 0.8492063492063492, 0.8650793650793651, 0.4523809523809524, 0.5634920634920635, 0.46825396825396826, 0.6666666666666666, 0.5476190476190477, 1.0, 0.36507936507936506, 0.6111111111111112, 0.8333333333333334, 0.42063492063492064, 0.0, 0.8253968253968254, 0.4523809523809524, 0.9523809523809523, 0.5873015873015873, 0.0, 0.6904761904761905]

* Finding the Nearest Neighbors

The K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm:

    1. Normalize the data

    2. Find the ~k~ nearest neighbors

    3. Classify the new point based on those neighbors

Now that our data has been normalized and we know how to find the distance between two points, we can begin classifying unknown data!

To do this, we want to find the k nearest neighbors of the unclassified point. In a few exercises, we'll learn how to properly choose k, but for now, let's choose a number that seems somewhat reasonable. Let's choose 5.

In order to find the 5 nearest neighbors, we need to compare this new unclassified movie to every other movie in the dataset. This means we're going to be using the distance formula again and again. We ultimately want to end up with a sorted list of distances and the movies associated with those distances.

It might look something like this:

#+begin_src python
[
  [0.30, 'Superman II'],
  [0.31, 'Finding Nemo'],
  ...
  ...
  [0.38, 'Blazing Saddles']
]
#+end_src

In  this example, the unknown movie has a distance of 0.30 to Superman II.

In the next exercise, we'll use the labels associated with these movies to classify the unlabeled point.

** Task 1
Begin by running the program. We've imported and normalized a movie dataset for you and printed the data for the movie Bruce Almighty. Each movie in the dataset has three features:

    - the normalized budget (dollars)

    - The normalized duration (minutes)

    - The normalized release year.

We've also imported the labels associated with every movie in the dataset. The label associated with Bruce Almighty is a 0, indicating that it is a bad movie. Remember, a bad movie had a rating less than 7.0 on IMDb.

Comment out the two print lines after you have run the program.

*Hint*
If you want to see more of the data, the following line of code will print 20 movies along with their data.

#+begin_src python
  print(list(movie_dataset.items())[:20])
#+end_src

** Task 2
Create a function called classify that has three parameters: the data point you want to classify named ~unknown~, the dataset you are using to classify it named ~dataset~, and ~k~, the number of neighbors you are interested in.

For now put ~pass~ inside your function.
      
** Task 3
Inside the classify function remove pass. Create an empty list called distances.

Loop through every title in the dataset.

Access the data associated with every title by using dataset[title].

Find the distance between dataset[title] and unknown and store this value in a variable called ~distance_to_point~.

Add the list ~[distance_to_point, title]~ to distances.

Outside of the loop, return distances.

** Task 4
We now have a list of distances and points. We want to sort this list by the distance (from smallest to largest). Before returning distances, use Python's built-in sort() function to sort distances.

** Task 5
The k nearest neighbors are now the first k items in distances. Create a new variable named neighbors and set it equal to the first k items of distances. You can use Python's built-in slice function.

For example, lst[2:5] will give you a list of the items at indices 2, 3 and 4 of lst.

Return neighbors.

** Task 6
Test the classify function and print the results. The three parameters you should use are:

    - [.4, .2, .9]

    - movie_dataset

    - 5

Take a look at the 5 nearest neighbors. In the next exercise, we'll check to see how many of those neighbors are good and how many are bad.

*Hint*

#+begin_src python
print(classify([.4, .2, .9], movie_dataset, 5))
#+end_src

** Script.py

#+begin_src python :results output
  from movies import movie_dataset, movie_labels

  print(movie_dataset['Bruce Almighty'])
  print(movie_labels['Bruce Almighty'])

  def distance(movie1, movie2):
      squared_difference = 0
      for i in range(len(movie1)):
          squared_difference += (movie1[i] - movie2[i]) ** 2
      final_distance = squared_difference ** 0.5
      return final_distance

  def classify(unknown, dataset, k):
      distances = []
      for title in dataset:
          movie = dataset[title]
          distance_to_point = distance(movie, unknown)
          distances.append([distance_to_point, title])
      distances.sort()
      neighbors = distances[0:5]
      return neighbors

  print(classify([.4, .2, .9], movie_dataset, 5))
#+end_src

* Count Neighbors
The K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm:

    - Normalize the data

    - Find the k nearest neighbors

    - Classify the new point based on those neighbors

We've now found the k nearest neighbors, and have stored them in a list thar looks like this:

#+begin_src python
[
  [0.083, 'Lady Vengeance'],
  [0.236, 'Steamboy'],
  ...
  ...
  [0.331, 'Godzilla 2000']
]
#+end_src

Our goal now is to count the number of good movies and bad movies in the list of neighbors. If more neighbors were good, then the algorithm will classify the unknown movie as good. Otherwise, it will classify it as bad.

In order to find the class o each of the labels, we'll need to look at our ~movie_labels~ dataset. For example, ~movie_labels['Akira']~ would give us 1 because Akira is classified as a good movie.

You may be wondering what happens if there's a tie. What if k = 8 and for neighbors were good and four neighbors were bad? There are different strategies, but one way to break the tie would be to /choose the class of the closest point./

** Task 1
Our classify function now needs to have knowledge of the labels. Add a parameter named labels to classify. It should be the third parameter.

** Task 2
Continue writing your classify function.

Create two variables named ~num_good~ and ~num_bad~ and set them each at 0. Use a for loop to loop through every movie in neighbors. Store their title in a variable called title.

Remember, every neighbor is a list of [distance, title] so the title can be found at index 1.

For now, return title at the end of your function (outside of the loop).

** Task 3
Use labels and title to find the label of each movie:

    - If that label is a 0, add one to ~num_bad.~

    - If that label is 1, add one to ~num_good.~

For now, return ~num_good~ at the end of your function.

*Hint*
You can find the label by using labels[title].

** Task 4
We can finally classify our unknown movie:

    - If num_good is greater than num_bad, return a 1

    - Otherwise, return a 0.

*Hint*
#+begin_src python
  if num_good > num_bad:
      return 1
  else:
      return 0
#+end_src

** Task 5
Call classify using the following parameters and print the result.

    - [.4, .2, .9] as the movie you’re looking to classify.

    - ~movie_dataset~ the training dataset.

    - ~movie_labels~ as the training labels.

    - k = 5


** Script.py

#+begin_src python
from movies import movie_dataset, movie_labels

def distance(movie1, movie2):
  squared_difference = 0
  for i in range(len(movie1)):
    squared_difference += (movie1[i] - movie2[i]) ** 2
  final_distance = squared_difference ** 0.5
  return final_distance

def classify(unknown, dataset, labels, k):
  distances = []
  #Looping through all points in the dataset
  for title in dataset:
    movie = dataset[title]
    distance_to_point = distance(movie, unknown)
    #Adding the distance and point associated with that distance
    distances.append([distance_to_point, title])
  distances.sort()
  #Taking only the k closest points
  neighbors = distances[0:k]
  num_good = 0
  num_bad = 0
  for neighbor in neighbors:
    title = neighbor[1]
    if labels[title] == 0:
      num_bad += 1
    elif labels[title] == 1:
      num_good += 1
  if num_good > num_bad:
    return 1
  else:
    return 0

print(classify([.4, .2, .9], movie_dataset, movie_labels, 5))
#+end_src

* Classify your favorite movie
Nice work! Your classifier is now able to predict whether a movie will be good or bad. So far, we've only tested this on a completely random point [.4, .2, .9]. In this exercise we're going to pick a real movie, normalize it, and run it through our classifier to see what it predicts!

In the instructions below, we are going to be testing our classifier using the 2017 movie Call Me By Your Name. Feel free to pick your favorite movie instead!

** Task 1
To begin, we want to make sure the movie that we want to classify isn't already in our database. This is important because we don't want one of the nearest neighbors to be itself!

We can do this by using the in keyword.

Begin by printing if the title of your movie is in movie_dataset. This should print False.

** Task 2
Once you confirm your movie is not in your database, we need to make a datapoint for your movie. Create a variable named my_movie and set it equal to a list of three numbers. They should be:

    - The movie's budget (dollars)

    - The movie's runtime (minutes)

    - The year the movie was released

Make sure to put the information in that order.

If you want to use Call Me By Your Name, the budget was 3.500.000 dollars, the runtime was 132 minutes, and the movie was released in 2017.

** Task 3
Next, we want to normalize this datapoint. We've included the function ~normalize_point~ which takes a datapoint as a parameter and returns the point normalized. Create a variable called ~normalized_my_movie~ and set it equal to the normalized value of ~my_movie~. Print the result!

** Task 4
Finally, call classify with the following parameters:

    - ~normalized_my_movie~

    - ~movie_dataset~

    - ~movie_labels~

    - 5

Print the result. Did your classifier think your movie was good or bad?

#+begin_src python
  classify(normalized_my_movie, movie_dataset, movie_labels, 5)
#+end_src

** Script.py

#+begin_src python
from movies import movie_dataset, movie_labels, normalize_point

def distance(movie1, movie2):
  squared_difference = 0
  for i in range(len(movie1)):
    squared_difference += (movie1[i] - movie2[i]) ** 2
  final_distance = squared_difference ** 0.5
  return final_distance

def classify(unknown, dataset, labels, k):
  distances = []
  #Looping through all points in the dataset
  for title in dataset:
    movie = dataset[title]
    distance_to_point = distance(movie, unknown)
    #Adding the distance and point associated with that distance
    distances.append([distance_to_point, title])
  distances.sort()
  #Taking only the k closest points
  neighbors = distances[0:k]
  num_good = 0
  num_bad = 0
  for neighbor in neighbors:
    title = neighbor[1]
    if labels[title] == 0:
      num_bad += 1
    elif labels[title] == 1:
      num_good += 1
  if num_good > num_bad:
    return 1
  else:
    return 0

print("Call Me By Your Name" in movie_dataset)

my_movie = [3500000, 132, 2017]

normalized_my_movie = normalize_point(my_movie)

classify(normalized_my_movie, movie_dataset, movie_labels, 5)

#+end_src

* Training and Validation Sets
You've now built your first K Nearest Neighbors algorithm capable of classification. You can feed your program a never-before-seen movie and it can predict whether its IMDb rating was above or below 7.0. However, we're not done yet. We now need to report how effective our algorithm is. After all, it's possible our prediction are totally wrong!

As with most machine learning algorithms, we have split our data into a training set and validation set.

Once these sets are created, we will want to use every point in the validation set as input to the K Nearest Neighbor algorithm. We will take a movie from the validation set, compare it to all the movies in the training set, find the K Nearest Neighbors, and make a prediction. After making that prediction, we can then peek at the real answer (found in the validation labels) to see it our classifier got the answer correct.

If we do this for every movie in the validation set, we can count the number of times the classifier got the answer right and the number of times it got it wrong. Using those two numbers, we can compute the validation accuracy.

Validation accuracy will change depending on what K we use. In the next exercise, we'll use the validation accuracy to pick the best possible K for our classifier.

** Task 1
We've imported ~training_set~, ~training_labels~, ~validation_set~, and ~validation_labels~. Let's take a look at one of the movies in ~validation_set~.

The movie "Bee Movie" is in ~validation_set~. Print out the data associated with Bee Movie. Print Bee Movie ‘s label as well (which can be found in ~validation_labels~).

Is Bee Movie a good or bad movie?

*Hint*

#+begin_src python
print(validation_set["Bee Movie"])
#+end_src

** Task 2
Let's have  our classifier predict whether Bee Movie is good or bad using k = 5. Call the classify function using the following parameters:

    - Bee Movie's data

    - ~training_set~

    - ~training_labels~

    - 5

Store the results in a variable named guess and print guess.

** Task 3
Let’s check to see if our classification got it right. If guess is equal to Bee Movie‘s real class (found in ~validation_labels~), print "Correct!". Otherwise, print "Wrong!".

* Choosing K
In the previous exercise, we found that our classifier got one point in the training set correct. Now we can test /every/ point to calculate  the validation accuracy.

The validation accuracy changes as k changes. The first situation that will be useful to consider is when k is very small. Let's say k = 1. We would expect the validation accuracy to be fairly low due to /overfitting./ Overfitting is a concept that will appear almost any time you are writting a machine learning algorithm. Overfitting occurs when you rely too heavily on your training data; you assume that data in the real world will always behave exactly like your training data. In the case of K-Nearest Neighbors, overfitting happens when you don't consider enough neighbors. A single outlier could drastically determine the label of an unknown point.

[[./dark_point.png]]

The dark blue point in the top left corner of the graph looks like a fairly significant outlier. When k = 1, all points in that general area will be classified as dark blue when it should probably be classified as green. Our classifier has relied too heavily on the small quirks in the training data.

On the other hand, if k is very large, our classifier will suffer from /underfitting./ Underfitting occurs when your classifier doesn't pay enough attention to the small quirks in the training set. Imagine you have 100 poitns in your training set and you set k = 100. Every single unknown point will be classified in the same exact way. The distances between the points don't matter at all! This is an extreme example, however, it demonstrates how the classifier can lose understanding of the training data if k is too big.

** Task 1
Begin by creating a function called ~find_validation_accuracy~ that takes five parameters. The parameters should be ~trainin_set~, ~training_labels~, ~validation_set~, ~validation_labels~, and ~k~.

** Task 2
Create a variable called ~num_correct~ and have it begin at 0.0. Loop through the movies of ~validation_set~, and call classify using each movie's data, the ~training_set~, the ~training_labels~, and ~k~. Store the result in a variable called guess. For now, return guess outside of your loop.

Remember, the movie's data can be found by using ~validation_set[title]~.

** Task 3
Inside the for loop, compare guess to the corresponding label in ~validation_labels~. If they were equal, add 1 to ~num_correct~. For now, outside of the for loop, return ~num_correct~.

*Hint*
The label that you want to compare guess to is ~validation_labels[title]~.

** Task 4
Outside the for loop return the validation error. This should be ~num_correct~ divided by the total number of points in the validation set.

** Task 5
Call ~find_validation_accuracy~ with k=3. Print the results. The code should take a couple of seconds to run.

** Script.py

#+begin_src python
  from movies import training_set, training_labels, validation_set, validation_labels

  def distance(movie1, movie2):
      squared_difference = 0
      for i in range(len(movie1)):
          squared_difference += (movie1[i] - movie2[i]) ** 2
      final_distance = squared_difference ** 0.5
      return final_distance

  def classify(unknown, dataset, labels, k):
      distances = []
      #Looping throug all points in the dataset
      for title in dataset:
          movie = dataset[title]
          distance_to_point = distance(movie, unknown)
          #Adding the distance and point associated with that distance
          distances.append([distance_to_point, title])
      distances.sort()
      #Taking only the k closest points
      neighbors = distances[0:k]
      num_good = 0

          guess = classify(validation_set[title], training_set, training_labels, k)
      if guess == validation_labels[title]:
          num_correct += 1

* Graph of K
The graph to the right shows the validation accuracy of our movie classifier as k increases. When k is small, overfitting occurs and the accuracy is relatively low. On the other hand, when k gets too large, underfitting occurs and accuracy starts to drop.

* Using sklearn
You've now written your own K-nearest Neighbor classifier from scratch! However, rather than writing your own classifier every time, you can use Python's sklearn library. sklearn is a Python library specifically used for Machine Learning. It has an amazing number of features, but for now, we're only going to investigate its K-Nearest Neighbor classifier.

There are a couple of steps we'll need to go through in order to use the library. First, you need to create a KNeighborsClassifier object. This object takes one parameter k. For example, the code below will create a classifier where k=3

#+begin_src python
  classifier = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors = 3)
#+end_src

Next, we'll need to train our classifier. The .fit() method takes two parameters. The first is a list of points, and the second is the labels associated with those points. So for our movie example, we might have something like this:

#+begin_src python
training_points = [
  [0.5, 0.2, 0.1],
  [0.9, 0.7, 0.3],
  [0.4, 0.5, 0.7]
]

training_labels = [0, 1, 1]
classifier.fit(training_points, training_labels)
#+end_src

Finally, after training the model, we can classify new points. The .predict() method takes a list of points that you want to classify. It returns a list of guesses for those points.

#+begin_src python
unknown_points = [
  [0.2, 0.1, 0.7],
  [0.4, 0.7, 0.6],
  [0.5, 0.8, 0.1]
]

guesses = classifier.predict(unknown_points)
#+end_src

** Task 1
We've imported sklearn for you. Create a KNeighborsClassifier named classifier that uses k=5.

** Task 2
We've also imported some movie data. Train your classifier using ~movie_dataset~ as the training points and labels as the training labels.

** Task 3
Let's classify some movies. Classify the followin movies [.45, .2, .5], [.25, .8, .9], [.1, .1, .9]. Print the classifications!

Which movies were classified as good movies and which were classified as bad movies?

Remember, those three numbers associated with a movie are the normalized budget, run time, and year of release.

** Script.py

#+begin_src python
  from movies import movie_dataset, labels
  from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier

  classifier = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors = 5)

  classifier.fit(movie_dataset, labels)

  unknown_movies = [[.45, .2, .5], [.25, .8, .9], [.1, .1, .9]]

  guesses = classifier.predict(unknown_movies)

  print(guesses)
#+end_src

* Review
Congratulations! You just implemented your very own classifier from scratch and used Python's sklearn library. In this lesson, you learned some techniques very specific to the K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm, but some general machine learning techniques as well. Some of the major takeaways from this lesson include:

    - Data with n features can be conceptualized as points lying in n-dimensional space.

    - Data points can be compared by using the distance formula. Data points that are similar will have a smaller distance between them.

    - A point with an unknown class can be classified by finding the k nearest neighbors.

    - To verify the effectiveness of a classifier, data with known classes can be split into a training set and a validation set. Validation error can then be calculated.

    - Classifier have parameters that can be tuned to increase their effectiveness. In the case of K-Nearest Neighbors, k can be changed.

    - A classifier can be trained improperly and suffer from overfitting or underfitting. In the case of K-Nearest Neighbors, a low k often leads to overfitting and a large k often leads to underfitting.

    - Python's sklearn library can be used for many classification and machine learning algorithms.

      To the right is an interactive visualization of K-Nearest Neighbors. If you move your mouse over the canvas, the location of your mouse will be classified as either green or blue. The nearest neighbors to your mouse are highlighted in yellow. Use the slider to change k to see how the boundaries of the classification change.

* Quiz
** Question 1
True/False: K-Nearest Neighbors can work with data with 1000 features.

*True*: K-Nearest Neighbors can work with data with any number of features greater than 0.

** Question 2
What  is a potential problem if k is even?
There could be an equal number of nearest neighbors from both classes.
If k = 2 and one neighbor is of class A, and the other is class B, which one should the classifier choose?

** Question 3
How does K-Nearest Neighbors define what it means for to points to be close to each other?

By using the distance formula using all features of the data.

Correct! The distance formula can work with any number of features.

** Question 4
Overfitting happens when:

Larger trends in the dataset aren't represented when k is too big.
If k is too small, outliers dominate the result.

** Question 5
Why is normalizing your data essential for K-Nearest Neighbors?

So a feature with a vastly different scale does not dominate other features.

If one feature is in the millions, and one feature is in the hundreds, the feature in the hundreds will hardly matter!

** Question 6
What would you expect to happen to the validation accuracy of a K-Nearest Neighbors classifier as k increases from 1 to infinity?

Validation accuracy goes up and then down.

If k is 1, the model is likely overfitted. Increasing k will improve accuracy. When k gets too big, accuracy will go down, since the model will begin to underfit the data.

** Question 7
What is the nearest neighbor to the point (1,2)?

    - (1,0)

    - (3,1)

    - (0,1)

    - *(1,3)*

** Question 8
Underfitting happens when:

k is too big so larger trends in the dataset aren't represented.

Correct! If k is the size of your training set, then all predictions will be the exact same.

** Question 9
The .predict() function in scikit-learn’s KNeighborClassifier class takes _____ as a parameter and returns _____.

A list of points to classify / a list of predictions

Correct! The input needs to be a list, even if it is only one point.
