    "*Differential calculus* is the field that studies rates of change. By `quantifying how variables relate to each other` we can better understand our statistical model or physical system. For example, as a data scientist at a t-shirt company, we may want to know how a change in the marketing budget impacts the company's total profit. Spend too little, and our product won't be well known; espend too much, and we might reach a point of diminishing returns where our money would be better spent elsewhere. How can we find the optimal size of our marketing budget?"

    "The last question above is the sort of questions asked and asnwered by the field of mathematical optimization, which interwines closely with calculus. Optimization problems involve looking for the best solution to a problem. Perhaps that's finding the 'optimal' size of the marketing budget for our company, the point where we maximize our profits with a budget that allows us to reach a broad audience without paying too much. Perhaps that means finding the statistical model that 'best' fits our data according to some criateria that we define ourselves -mathematical optimization gives us a way to decide among all our possible options. It is a powerful field that underpins much of the modern machine learning revolution an it is build upon the fundamentals of calculus we will investigate."

We will discuss this at length in the upcoming lesson. To give a rough overview, however, the idea is that by zooming in enough and considering how a variable changes over an infinitesimal time frame, we can learn how that variable is changing instantaneously, at a specific moment in time."

    "Calculus gives us ways to determine how a response variable (like profit, or revenue, or click-through rate) changes with related independent variables (like gas prices, or click-through rate, or time). Understanding how independent variables change with respect to a response variable is essential for choosing an ideal model because it allows us to answer the following question: \"what is the most effective model for our given situation?\". We will learn some fundamental of calculus and gain some tools that data scientist use in their everyday jobs."
