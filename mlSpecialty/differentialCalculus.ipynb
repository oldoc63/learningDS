For example, as a data scientist at a t-shirt company, we may want to know how a change in the marketing budget impacts the company's total profit. Spend too little, and our product won't be well known; espend too much, and we might reach a point of diminishing returns where our money would be better spent elsewhere. How can we find the optimal size of our marketing budget?"

Perhaps that means finding the statistical model that 'best' fits our data according to some criateria that we define ourselves -mathematical optimization gives us a way to decide among all our possible options.
