    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to analyse biodiversity data from the National Parks Service, particularly around various species observed in different national park locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will scope, analyze, prepare, plot data, and seek to explain the findings from the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few questions that this project has sought to answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the distribution of conservation status for species?\n",
    "- Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?\n",
    "- Are the differences between species adn their conservation status significant?\n",
    "- Which animal is most prevalent and what is their distribution amongst parks?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data sources:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Both`Observations.csv` and `Species_info.csv` was provided by [Codecademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The data for this project is *inspired* by real data, but is mostly fictional."

    "## Scoping\n",
    "\n",
    "It's beneficial to create a project scope whenever a new project is being started. Four sections were created below to help guide the project's process and progress. The first section is the project goals, this setion will deine the high-level objectives and set the intentions for this project. Tne next section is the data, luckily in this project, data is already provided but still needs to be checked if project goals can be met with the availabledata. Thirdly, the analysis will have to be thought through, which include the methods and questions that are aligned with the project goals. Lastly, evaluation will help us build conclusions and findings from our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project the perspective will be through a biodiversity analyst for the National Parks Service. The National Park Service wants to ensure the survival of at-risk species, to maintain the level of biodiversity within their parks. Therefore, the main objectives as an analyst will be understanding characteristics about the species and their conservations status, and those species and their relationship to the national parks. Some questions that are posed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the distribution of conservation status for species?\n",
    "- Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?\n",
    "- Are the differences between species and their conservation status significant?\n",
    "- Which animal is most prevalent and what is their distribution amongst parks?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "This project has two data sets that came with the package. The first `csv` file has information about each species and another has observations of species with park locations. This data will be used to analyze the goals of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques will be employed to understand the data better. Statistical inference will also be used to test if the observed values are statistically significant. Some of the key metrics that will be computed include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Distributions\n",
    "2. Counts\n",
    "3. Relationship between species\n",
    "4. Conservation status of species\n",
    "5. Observations of species in parks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, it's a good idea to revisit the goals and check if the output of the analysis corresponds to the questions first set to be answered (in the goals section). This section will also reflect on what has been learned through the process, an if any of the questions were unable to be answered. This could also include limitations or if any of the analysis could have been done using different methodologies."
