** What are the parameter(s) of scikit-learn's ~f1_score~ function?

    -  A true label followed by a prediction

    - *A list of true labels followed by a list of predictions*
      Correct! Even if there's only one data point and one prediction, it needs to be in a list.

    - A list of predictions followed by a list of true labels

   - A prediction followed by a true label

** A false positive is when:

    - The true label is a 1 and the prediction is a 0.

    - *The true label is a 0 and the prediction is a 1.*
      Correct! The classifier guessed it was positive, but that was false.

    - The true label is a 0 and the prediction is a 0.

    - The true label is a 1 and the prediction is a 1.

** Precision is defined as:

    - The number of correct classifications out of all classifications.

    - The number of relevant items selected out of all relevant items.

    - The harmonic mean of accuracy and recall.

    - *The number of relevant items out of all items selected.*
      Correct! Precision is true positives divided by true positives plus false positives.

** In the image below, the circle with the solid line represents the true label of points. Points that fall in the circle have tha label ~1~ and points outside the circle have the label ~0~. The circle with the dotted line represents the classification's guess -if the point is inside the dotted circle, it has been classified as a ~1~, otherwise, it is classified as a ~0~. What is the equation for recall?

[[./recall_venn.png]]

    - \frac{B}{B + D}
       ~D~ represents true negatives. We want true positive divided by false negative plus true positive

     - \frac{B}{B + A}
       Recall is the true positives divided by the true positives plus the false negatives. B represents the true positives and A represents the false negatives.

** Why is the F1 score calculated using the harmonic mean?

    - The harmonic mean takes less time to compute than the arithmetic mean.

    - *The harmonic mean makes F1 score low when either precision or recall is low.*

    - The harmonic mean will consider precision and recall equally.

    - The F1 score is calculated using the arithmetic mean.

** Given the following values, what is the recall of the classifier?

#+begin_src python :results output
  true_positives = 2
  true_negatives = 3
  false_positives = 1
  false_negatives = 4

  recall = true_positives / (true_positives + false_negatives)

  print(recall)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 0.3333333333333333

** If the true labels of your data are [1, 0, 1, 1] and the prediction from the classifier are [1, 1, 1, 0], then the prediction at index 3 is a:

    - False negative
      The classifier guessed it was negative, but that was wrong.

** In the image below, the circle with the solid line represents the true label of points. Points that fall in the circle have the label ~1~ and points outside the circle have the label ~0~. The circle with the dotted line represents the classification's guess -if the point is inside the dotted circle, it has been classified as a ~1~, otherwise, it is classified as a ~0~. What is the equation for accuracy?

- \frac {B + D}{A + B + C + D}
