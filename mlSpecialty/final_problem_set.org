* Final Problem Set
Assess your math skills with a problem set.

Congrats for making it through Fundamental Math for Data Science! To assess your knowledge of content from the path, we put together some questions for you to try.

Here are some things you should know before you begin:

    Some problems are designed to be done by hand, while some are coding questions.
    All problems are based on the material taught in the exercises; using outside sources to solve these problems is discouraged.
    If you feel stuck, feel free to use the hint provided to help you out.
    When you submit your final answer, an example solution will be provided to you so you can compare both your answer and strategy to solve it.
