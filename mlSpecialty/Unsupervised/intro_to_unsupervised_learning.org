* An Introduction to Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised Learning describes a class of algorithms that find patterns from /unlabelled or untagged/ data. In supervised learning, we deal with data that is labelled or tagged. For example, we predict continuous outcomes in /regression/ (for instance, predictin housing prices) or categorical outcomes in /classification/ (spam versus not spam, for example). However, often training data isn't labelled in this manner and this is where unsupervised learning comes in! It relies on using the *underlying distributions of features within the data* to figure out clusters of similarity.

Unsupervised learning methods are extremely important to the functioning of many real-world algorithms -think image recognition, ride-shares anticipating demands, snapchat filters and many more! There are three primary ways they're used:

    - *Clustering*: Identifying clusters within a dataset like identifying disease outbreak clusters or in natural language processing, in creating word clouds that are semantically related, etc.

    - *Dimensionality Reduction/Feature Extraction*: They can be used to condense the number of features in a dataset with a high number of features before applying a supervised learning algorithm.

    - *Automated Labelling/Tagging*: Unsupervised learning algorithms are immensely useful in categorizing uncategorized data and one can then perform the familiar classification/regression tasks using supervised learning.

In this module we will focus on two of the most commonly used unsupervised learning techniques -Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-Means Clustering. The former is most often used for dimensionality reduction and the latter is used in clustering problems primarily. After this module you will be able to:

    - Perform dimensionality reduction using PCA

    - Classify images using PCA

    - Find clusters within data using K-Means

    - Extract features using PCA and K-Means

** Introduction to Clustering
Often, the data you encounter in the real world won't be sorted into categories and won't have labeled answers to your question. Finding patterns in this type of data, unlabeled data, is a common theme in many machine learning applications. /Unsupervised Learning/ is how we find patterns and structure in these data.

*Clustering* is the most well-known unsupervised learning technique. It finds structure in unlabeled data by identifying similar groups, or /clusters./ Examples of clustering applications are:

    - *Recommendation engines:* group products to personalize the user experience

    - *Search engines:* group news topics and search results

    - *Market segmentation:* group customers based on geography, demography, and behaviors

    - *Image segmentation:* medical imaging or road scene segmentation on self-driving cars

    - *Text clustering:* group similar texts together based on word usage

The /Iris/ data set is a famous example of unlabeled data. It consist of measurements of sepals and petals on 50 different iris flowers. Here you can see a visualization of this data set that shows how the flowers naturally form three distinct clusters. We'll learn how to find those clusters in this lesson.
