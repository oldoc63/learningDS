* Perceptron Logic Gates
In this project, we will use perceptrons to model the fundamental building blocks of computers -logic gates.

For example, the table below show the results of a AND gate. Given two inputs, an AND gate will output a 1 only if both inputs are a 1:

| Input 1 | Input 2 | Output |
|       0 |       0 |      0 |
|       0 |       1 |      0 |
|       1 |       0 |      0 |
|       1 |       1 |      1 |

We'll discuss how an AND gate can be thought of as linearly separable data and train a perceptron to perform AND.

We'll also investigate an XOR gate - a gate that outputs a 1 only if one of the inputs is a 1:

| Input 1 | Input 2 | Output |
|       0 |       0 |      0 |
|       0 |       1 |      1 |
|       1 |       0 |      1 |
|       1 |       1 |      0 |

We'll think about why an XOR gate isn't linearly separable and show how a perceptron fails to learn XOR.
