Bar Charts

    Bar charts are useful for visualizing counts of categorical data.
    In a bar chart, the height and area are proportional to the value represented. This makes it easy to compare different variables in the bar graph.
    Seaborn is a library that makes it easy to create bar charts with the .countplot() method.
    Bar charts have the broadest appeal and are the most common go-to when plotting categorical data.

Pie Charts

    A pie chart is another way to represent categorical data. Instead of displaying counts of categorical data through bars, a pie chart shows a part-to-whole relationship by displaying each variable as a sector on a circle.
    In a pie chart, the arc length and area of each sector are proportional to the value they represent.
    You can plot pie charts in Python using the .pie() method in Matplotlib.
    Pie chart sectors often harder to compare than simple bars, and having too many sectors causes clutter in the visual quickly. This makes use cases for pie charts more limited.
