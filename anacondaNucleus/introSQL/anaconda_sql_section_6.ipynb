fields like `CUSTOMER_ID`, it is a good rule of thumb to prefer the one in the parent table in case you switch your `INNER JOIN` to a left `LEFT JOIN` so it never becomes `NULL`. We will learn about this later. \n","\n","The `INNER JOIN` allows us to stitch both tables together and define the commonality using the `ON` keyword, which is where our join condition goes. You can actually specify any condition you want for a `JOIN`, but 99.9% of the time you will likely use a simple equals `=` to line up records between the two tables. \n","\n","Another way to think of this is we are copying each `CUSTOMER` record across each respective `CUSTOMER_ORDER` sharing that respective `CUSTOMER_ID`. \n","\n","> Occasionally, you might come across colleagues who simply write `JOIN` rather than `INNER JOIN`. This is a shorthand or alias for an `INNER JOIN`, but it is better practice to explicitly express `INNER JOIN` so you make it clear that was the type of join you intended. \n","\n","You also should avoid using an old convention of inner joining by selecting tables in a comma-separated way, and using the `WHERE` condition for your join condition as shown below.

This means the order you declare the tables in your `FROM` matters with a `LEFT JOIN`. \n","\n","\n","> There is also a `RIGHT JOIN` or `RIGHT OUTER JOIN` operator, which flips the direction and includes all records in the `RIGHT` table even if there are none to join to in the `LEFT` table. However it is seldom used as what can be done with a `RIGHT JOIN` can also be achieved with a `LEFT JOIN`. There is also a `FULL OUTER JOIN` which includes all records in both directions, but it also is rarely used. As a matter of fact, SQLite does not support the `RIGHT JOIN` or `FULL OUTER JOIN` for this reason. \n","\n","As we will see, this can be useful for creating reports later as we likely want to include customers that do not have any orders. Another common use case for `LEFT JOIN` is finding parent records that do not have any children, such as `CUSTOMER` records that do not have any `CUSTOMER_ORDER` records. We can do this by qualifying any `CUSTOMER_ORDER` fields to be null, which normally are not null but consequently become null as a result of the `LEFT JOIN`.
