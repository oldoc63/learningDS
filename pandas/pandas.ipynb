    "Pandas is a very popular library for working with data (its goal is to be the most powerful and flexible open-source tool, and it has reached that goal). DataFrames are at the center of Pandas. A DataFrame is structured like a table or spreadsheet. The rows and the columns both have indexes, and you can perform operations on rows or columns separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "A pandas DataFrame can be easily changed and manipulated. Pandas has helpful functions for handling missing data, performing operations on columns and rows, and transforming data. If that wasn't enough, a lot of SQL functions have counterparts in pandas, such as join, merge, filter by, and group by. With all this powerful tools, it should come as no surprise that pandas is very popular among data scientists.\n",
    "\n",
    "### NumPy\n",
    "Numpy is an open-source Python library that facilitates efficient numerical operations on large quantities of data. There are a few functions that exist in NumPy that we use on pandas DataFrames. For us, the most important part about NumPy is that pandas is built on top of it. So, NumPy is a dependency of Pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've installed those libraries, you're ready to open any Python coding environment (we recommend Jupyter Notebook). Before you can use these libraries, you'll need to import them using the following lines of code. We'll use the abbreviations np and pd, respectively, to simplify our functions calls in the future."

    "### Pandas Series and Dataframes\n",
    "Just as the ndarray is the foundation of the NumPy library, the Series is the core object of the pandas library. A pandas Series is very similar to a one-dimensional NumPy array, but it has additional functionality that allows values in the series to be indexed using labels.A NumPy array does not have the flexibility to do this. This labeling is useful when you are storing pieces of data that have other data associated with then. Say you want to store the ages of students in an online course to eventually figure out the average student age. If stored in a NumPy array, you could only access these ages with the internal ndarray indices 0,1,2... With a Series object, the indices of values are set to 0,1,2... by default, but you can can customize the indices to be other values such as student names so and age can be accessed using a name. Customized indices of a Series are established by sending values into the Series constructor, as you will see below.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Series holds items of any one data type and can be created by sending in a scalar value, Python list, dictionary, or ndarray as a parameter to the pandas Series constructor. If a dictionary is sent in, the keys may be used as the indices. "
